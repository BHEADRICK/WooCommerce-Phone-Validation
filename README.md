## Description ##

Validates phone numbers at checkout. 

By default, WooCommerce only validates that the phone number fields contain characters valid for a phone number, 
but does not validate that is a proper number of digits or whether it is a real phone number. 

This initial release only validates US phone numbers, but also includes optional integration with Numverify (https://numverify.com/) which supports validation for 232 countries, and has very reasonable pricing. (Free for up to 250 validations/mo).
